### **1. Introduction**

Chest X-rays are widely used in the medical field for diagnosing diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. However, many chest X-ray images suffer from **low contrast** or poor visibility of structures, especially in dark or bright regions. This makes it difficult for radiologists to clearly identify abnormalities.
The goal of this project is to **enhance chest X-ray images** using digital image processing techniques so that details inside the lungs and bone structures become more visible for diagnostic purposes.

### **2. Dataset**

- **Source**: Publicly available Chest X-Ray dataset (e.g., Kaggle “Chest X-Ray Images” dataset).
- **Format**: Images are grayscale, stored in `.png` or `.jpeg` format.
- **Resolution**: Varies from 1024×1024 to smaller resolutions (depending on source).
- **Preprocessing**: Images are converted to grayscale if not already.

### **3. Methodology & Justification**

#### **Technique 1: Power-Law (Gamma) Transformation**

- **Justification**: Gamma transformation is effective in controlling brightness.

  - If **γ < 1**, dark regions are brightened (useful for lung details hidden in dark areas).
  - If **γ > 1**, bright regions are compressed (useful if image is overexposed).

- **Transformation Function**:

  $$
  s = c \cdot r^\gamma
  $$

  where $r$ = input pixel intensity (normalized \[0,1]), $\gamma$ = gamma value, and $c=1$.

#### **Technique 2: Histogram Equalization (HE)**

- **Justification**: HE redistributes pixel intensities across the full range \[0–255].
  This enhances global contrast, making bones and tissues more distinguishable.
- **Transformation Function (CDF-based mapping)**:

  $$
  s_k = (L-1) \cdot \sum_{j=0}^k p(r_j)
  $$

  where $p(r_j)$ = probability of intensity level $r_j$, $L=256$.

---

#### **Technique 3: Contrast Stretching**

- **Justification**: If useful pixel intensities lie in a limited range (say 50–200), contrast stretching maps them to \[0,255].
- **Transformation Function**:

  $$
  s = \frac{(r-r_{min})}{(r_{max}-r_{min})} \cdot 255
  $$

  where $r_{min}$ and $r_{max}$ are chosen thresholds.

#### **Technique 4: Combination (Gamma + Histogram Equalization)**

- **Justification**: A two-step process can yield better results:

  1. Gamma correction brightens hidden details in dark lung areas.
  2. Histogram Equalization redistributes them across the full intensity range.

- **Expected Benefit**: Balanced contrast and better visibility of both dark and bright regions.

### **4. Results & Analysis**

#### **Visual Comparison**

- Present **Original vs Enhanced images** side-by-side for each technique (your dashboard already shows this).

#### **Histogram Analysis**

- **Gamma Transformation**: Histogram shifts right (γ<1) or left (γ>1). Doesn’t always cover full range.
- **Histogram Equalization**: Histogram spreads more evenly across \[0–255].
- **Contrast Stretching**: Histogram stretched across full range with spikes at 0 and 255 (clipping).
- **Gamma + HE**: Histogram spans 0–255, distribution smoother and more balanced.

#### **Critical Evaluation**

- Gamma alone is useful if the image is too dark or bright but may not improve all regions.
- Histogram Equalization works well for overall contrast but sometimes over-enhances noise.
- Contrast Stretching gives strong expansion but may lose details in extreme regions.
- Gamma + Histogram Equalization generally gave the **best results** for chest X-rays: lung details became clearer, bone visibility improved, and contrast was balanced.

### **5. Conclusion**

- **Most Effective Technique**: The **combination of Gamma Transformation + Histogram Equalization** produced the most balanced and clinically useful enhancement.
- **Recommendation**: For medical imaging tasks like chest X-rays, a two-step enhancement pipeline should be preferred over single transformations.
